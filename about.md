# Acerca De

Disculpe la tardanza, esta pagina sera actualizada con la informaci√≥n sobre la administradora del sitio y sus razones  


*Pardon my dust, this page will be updated soon to provide information about the website creator and the inspiration for the project.*

*This site will serve as a repository to bring together education-related resources offered to Spanish-speakers by libraries in the area, as well as nonprofits. Even though this information might already be advertised by the organizing entity, this webpage will pool together these resources and display all the pertinent information in Spanish. This will help local members of the community more aware of the services offered and will help them on their journey to be more empowered citizens.*
